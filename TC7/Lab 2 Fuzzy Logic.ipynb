Let it be any friendship, any relationship, I have always worried about what if I fuck things up, what if they abandon me one day, If i mess it all up will they disapprove of what I am and not consider me to be a part of their lives. What if they eventually stop liking me... Guess what, the irony is, I always end up messing things out of fear.* \n",

Took my dumb brain 21 years to understand this but life is a long journey and a lot of people will come around during this time. Some, will impact it very heavily, heavier than you can imagine. I found one a few months ago. I dont know if to credit this to them or not but I finally know I am very happy not caring about what they'd think of me, I can be honest and vulnerable with them because I know I wont be judged and I will be accepted for who I am, no matter my flaws. This person is one hell of a gem. But anyway, lets see where time takes us and who we turn out to be...*\n",
